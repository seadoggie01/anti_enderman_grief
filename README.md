# anti_enderman_grief
## A Minecraft 1.13 datapack that stops Enderman from ruining your world. ##

Don't you hate it when Enderman pick up the top of your hill and run off with it? Download this datapack to stop those tall, pesky freaks from touching your stuff!

This pack works by over-riding the 'minecraft:enderman_holdable' tag on every block. Only blocks tagged with such a tag can be held by enderman. As an added bonus, they don't look like they're holding anything in their hands while exploring your world either. They simply leave the blocks alone.
